    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",

    "Dear Madam Mayor and local school board trustees,\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an in-depth analysis of the standardized test results from our local high schools. In order to give you actionable insights from our students' results, I have compiled several tables that display different snapshots of the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Included is a high-level snapshot of the district; a summary of all the schools showing their budgets, test scores and passing rates; lists of the top-five and bottom-five performing schools for overall passing rate; math and reading scores broken down by individual grade for each school; as well as a look at how school's perform based on their per-capita budget, student population and whether they are a District or Charter school. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of datapoints we can use to inform decisions at the board level, but some key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The obvious disparity between District and Charter schools presents a wide gap. This is not unexpected, as Charter schools operate on the basis of their individual contracts with the state and are dependent on high test scores to meet their funding agreement for continued operation. While it may not be a surprise, it is a finding worth highlighting to consider implementing some of the strategies used by our Charter schools when it comes to student success.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As you can see from the spending summary, throwing money at the problem isn't a solution in and of itself. Many of our District schools that are struggling with overall passing rates currently receive the most funding per student. In fact, the five worst-performing schools for passing rate fall into the highest or second-highest bracket for per-capita funding. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The primary target for raising our passing rates for students would be to invest in math fundamentals at the District schools. Consistently, these schools have the lowest percentage of students meeting a passing grade, which is a significant contributor to the low overall passing rates. While 80.80% of our District students are meeting the mark for reading, only 66.55% of them are passing in math. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Not too much insight can be gleaned from the school size summary, as our largest schools are largely the same District schools that are struggling in math. \n",
    "\n",
